Over the course of my rather short but on-going web development journey, there have been numerous times where the use of static font unit in responsive web have created both aesthetic and legibility problems (Probably from my lack of web development skills too). With fluid typography, it opens up for a more complete responsive approach when it comes to defining font sizes (without using javaScript). This also means it also serves as a good alternative to 'expanding columns' or at the very least simplifies the process when using these two methods in conjunction.
